SYN Flood Tool
This repository contains a SYN Flood tool, designed for educational, research, and testing purposes only. This tool simulates a SYN flood attack, a form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which exploits the TCP three-way handshake to overwhelm a target server.

Disclaimer: This tool is provided for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly, and only in environments where you have explicit permission to test network security, such as in penetration testing or with the consent of the network owner. Unauthorized use of this tool can be illegal and is strictly prohibited.

About
This SYN Flood tool simulates a SYN flood attack by sending a large number of SYN requests to a target IP address, aiming to overwhelm its resources and make the service unavailable.

Note: A SYN flood attack is an attack against the TCP/IP protocol that can disrupt services on a network, but should only be conducted in controlled environments (like a lab or with permission for penetration testing).

Features
Simulate SYN flood attacks on a target.

Control the rate of attack packets.

Supports specifying the target IP and port.

Monitor attack progress in real-time.

Built with [Python/Other language] (if applicable).

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/syn-flood-tool.git
cd syn-flood-tool
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the necessary permissions (root/admin) to run the tool, as it may require raw socket access.

Usage
To run the SYN Flood tool, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python syn_flood.py <target-ip> <target-port> [options]
Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
python syn_flood.py 192.168.1.100 80 --rate 1000
This will send 1000 SYN packets per second to the target IP at port 80.

Options:
--rate <rate>: Specify the rate of packets (default is 1000 pps).

--duration <time>: Specify how long the attack should run (default is unlimited).

--verbose: Show detailed logs.

What You Can and Cannot Do
What You Can Do:
Use this tool for educational and research purposes in a controlled, isolated environment (e.g., a lab setup).

Use this tool with explicit permission for penetration testing or security assessments where the network owner has granted you access.

Contribute to the project by submitting bug reports, fixing issues, or improving functionality under the ethical guidelines mentioned.

What You Cannot Do:
Do not use this tool on any system or network without explicit permission. Unauthorized usage is illegal and could result in criminal prosecution.

Do not use this tool for any malicious activity. Engaging in DDoS attacks or any form of disruptive behavior without consent is unethical and illegal.

Do not use this tool to target systems that you do not own or have explicit written consent to test. Any unauthorized use could lead to severe legal consequences, including imprisonment.

Do not modify or distribute the tool for illegal purposes. Redistribution with intent to harm or damage systems violates both ethical and legal standards.

Legal & Ethical Considerations
Important:
DO NOT use this tool on any system or network without explicit permission. Unauthorized use can result in legal action, including criminal charges.

Only use this tool in controlled environments, such as penetration testing on your own systems, with clear consent, or within legal boundaries.

The authors and maintainers of this repository are not responsible for any damages caused by misuse of this tool.

If you are unsure about the legality of using this tool in your location or situation, DO NOT use it. Always prioritize ethical hacking practices and act responsibly.
