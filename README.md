#SYN FLOOD


This SYN Flood tool simulates a SYN flood attack by sending a large number of SYN requests to a target IP address, aiming to overwhelm its resources and make the service unavailable.

Note: A SYN flood attack is an attack against the TCP/IP protocol that can disrupt services on a network, but should only be conducted in controlled environments (like a lab or with permission for penetration testing).

Features
Simulate SYN flood attacks on a target.

Control the rate of attack packets.

Supports specifying the target IP and port.

Monitor attack progress in real-time.

Built with [Python/Other language] (if applicable).

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/syn-flood-tool.git
cd syn-flood-tool
Install the required dependencies:

Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
python syn_flood.py 192.168.1.100 80 --rate 1000
This will send 1000 SYN packets per second to the target IP at port 80.

Options:
--rate <rate>: Specify the rate of packets (default is 1000 pps).

--duration <time>: Specify how long the attack should run (default is unlimited).
